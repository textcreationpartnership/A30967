            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have thus long purpoſely forborn to give you particular thanks for your most reſpective incouraging Letters, with which you were pleaſed to grace me, whileſt I was labouring in this my work, becauſe I thought it to be my bounden duty for to do it, by offering in a more open way, <hi>the whole</hi> of it unto you, ſo ſoon as ever it ſhould be finiſhed. You ſtooped exceedingly low, when you thought any of my former labours, extremely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by ſome, worth your peruſal; but much lower, when you could find any thing in them worth your <hi>Commendation.</hi> It is eaſie to be diſcerned, that the altitude of your <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> which latter is not ſo much an honour to you, as it is honoured by you, have not made you <hi>ſupercilious,</hi> against thoſe of a far lower <hi>form,</hi> both in <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>ſtation.</hi> Most modest Sir, let him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your <hi>indignation</hi> ſay it, and be believed in it, (who yet was never ſo ſordidly unhappy, and truſts, never ſhall be, as for ſelf-ends to be a <hi>Spaniel</hi> to the gallantest of men) that I hardly know any mere <hi>individual</hi> alive upon the face of the Earth, unto whom, under God, I would more deſire to approve all my <hi>Travai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:59316:4"/> miſcarriages about them, than by your ſelf; and that becauſe of thoſe tranſcendent excellencies of <hi>vaſt Learning,</hi> of <hi>unfaigned pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> of <hi>graceful gravity, mixt with ſweet moderation,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who knowes you, will bleſſe God for appearing to be in you, far ſooner than with any the leaſt <hi>oſtentation,</hi> you will own them to be in your ſelf. Upon this <hi>account</hi> and <hi>ſcore</hi> alone it is, that I make it my humble and earnest request unto you, that you would take <hi>full liberty,</hi> most <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>boldly</hi> to cenſure, whatſoever you ſhall in this, or in any former work, find enormiouſly <hi>peccant</hi> againſt either the <hi>grounds of true learning,</hi> or againſt <hi>the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or goodneſs of the cauſe</hi> defended by me, or ſo much as (all circumſtances duly pondered &amp; caſt up) against the <hi>parts, place, or perſon of my Adverſary.</hi> The more ſevere <hi>Critick</hi> you ſhall prove againſt me, in caſe of my demerits, the more I will promiſe perpetual thankfulneſs unto you, and, upon a clear diſcovery, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of all faults, to the utmoſt of what my <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> by way of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> can wiſh for from my hands. Indeed by the <hi>exuberancies</hi> of my <hi>paſſions</hi> against him here and there, (and, as yet I think, not without juſt cauſe) it may eaſily be diſcerned, that I am not much tranſported with that vulgarly taking Opinion, that now adayes <hi>Engliſh Hereticks are only to be killed with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but if any but from a too <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>facile</hi> a miſtake of my <hi>ſtyle,</hi> ſhall ſo far miſtake the <hi>Temper</hi> of my affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any thing that is commendable and extremely gallant (as many things are) in the parts of my Adverſary, he puts a foul <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm</hi> upon himſelf, and <hi>miſerably</hi> miſtakes me. I ſhould be full ſorrowful, if any ſhould <hi>value</hi> more what is <hi>prayſe-worthy</hi> in him then my ſelf or any be more <hi>ſolicitous</hi> of every thing he ought to ſet a priſe upon, as upon his <hi>ſoul, his fame,</hi> his very outward <hi>ſafety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Had no ſooner ſent away this <hi>Dedicatory,</hi> for the reaſons expreſſed in it, to the <hi>Sonne in Law;</hi> but that very after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, a <hi>Neighbouring Divine</hi> acqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nted me, (which till then, I was altogether ignorant of) of my Adverſaries <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick appearing</hi> againſt his moſt Reverend <hi>Father in Law,</hi> in a Book which he calls, <hi>The Divine Purity defended;</hi> as if any of his Adverſaries had oppoſed that, who believe nothing ſo ſtrongly as they do believe, that <hi>God is holineſs</hi> and <hi>purity it ſelf, and holy in all his wayes and works, and that there is no iniquity in him.</hi> Truly at first, it was ſome more then <hi>ordinary grief</hi> to me, that ſo great a man, and ſo cordial a friend, as Doctor <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> hath been to me, (and that as I take it, for no other reaſon, but that he reckons me among <hi>Chriſts friends)</hi> ſhould in the midſt of his most bleſſed imployments, meet with ſo much troubleſom <hi>interruption,</hi> for any thing he hath written in my behalf, from ſo inſolent a wrangler. Really, I can find no <hi>lenitive</hi> for this <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> but what I fetch from <hi>the Sanctuary,</hi> viz. from the hopes which I have, that he whoſe way is often to work <hi>by contraries,</hi> and to <hi>bring light</hi> out <hi>of darkneſs,</hi> will do me, will (which is a <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6</note> great deal better) do his Church much good by it. Upon occaſion of this ſo maſculine an oppoſition of ſo good and ſo <hi>noted a Divine,</hi> it may poſſibly be believed by the moſt;</p>
            <p>Firſt, That how <hi>modeſtly</hi> ſoever Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> did, at his first ſetting forth, appear to ſome leſſe acquainted with him to be in his <hi>Correct Copy,</hi> that the heighth of his Spirit (as well then known to me as it is now) did then deſign, that that <hi>Copy</hi> ſhould be as a <hi>Gantlet</hi> thrown down to the ablest Divines of the Nation, though at first neceſſary to be taken up by me, who ſhall ever have reaſon to profeſs my ſelf to be the meanest amongſt thoſe <hi>whom</hi> God hath <hi>called to be faithful. Primum in intentione, eſt ultimum in executione.</hi> Who ſees not now that his <hi>Correct Copy,</hi> and the things by which he hath ſince ſupported it, are juſt ſuch <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59316:6"/> as ere while in our Neighbour Countrey, were the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Remonſtrantia Remonſtrantium?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Probably ſome now, who have but too unhappily ſymbolized with my Adverſary, about my <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their <hi>miſtake,</hi> and be pleaſed to <hi>read</hi> me more, and <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> me <hi>leſſe.</hi> And truly, unleſs they can be perſwaded to read all on both ſides; and withall, to weigh all <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I could heartily wiſh they would leave all unread, <hi>Pauca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicientes faci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Reverend Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> (in <hi>words</hi> handled leſs <hi>irreverently</hi> then my ſelf, but in very deeds full out as <hi>irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>want only)</hi> or any, far meaner than himſelf, ſhall judge it <hi>fitting to ſtoop</hi> ſo low, as to return any thing more to the laſt <hi>Scriblings</hi> of my <hi>Adverſary.</hi> Firſt, I hope it will be no matter of grief unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to find, that in my <hi>firſt,</hi> and in this <hi>latter labor</hi> of mine, I have according to my poor power, given them ſome no inconſiderable <hi>hints</hi> which poſſibly may ſomewhat leſſen their pains. Secondly, I ſhall not in the leaſt faſhion, be <hi>ſollicitous,</hi> how they will uſe my <hi>name or fame,</hi> which I ſet at a rate, ten thouſand times lower then I do the truths which I have endeavoured, <hi>pro meo poſſe,</hi> to defend: and of which I am confident, none appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Dr. <hi>Reinolds,</hi> will be the betrayers. I am as <hi>confident, as confidence it ſelf almoſt can make me,</hi> that that will never be verified in them, which <hi>Luther</hi> in his dayes complained of in ſome, <hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luther.</note>
               </hi> that <hi>Nunquam periclitatur Religio niſi inter Reverendiſſimos.</hi> Thirdly, I will upon my honeſt word, aſſure any body, that I ſhall be hugely well pleaſed, that any who ſhall take up the pen next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> would write leſſe ſharply, if he judge that the <note place="margin">Auſtin <hi>did uſe to ſay of</hi> Pelagius, <hi>that</hi> Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ab ipſo cupiebat or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari.</note> fitteſt way to ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n upon the gallant parts of the man, that (if God pleaſe) they may at leaſt become ſerviceable to the Church. None ſhall be more joyful to have the Lord, rather than the Devil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned by his <hi>fine,</hi> would to God they were <hi>gracious, abilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I take it to be a moſt <hi>Signal</hi> and <hi>Remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> that juſt at this time, the Book of Dr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> which I make mention of in this, part 2. p. 138. is come forth in anſwer to <hi>Fur Praedeſtinatus</hi> the <hi>firſt:</hi> Every learned Reader (ſay my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Kendal, Fur pro Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunali.</note> what he pleaſe to the contrary,) will eaſily be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that with ſome very ſlight immutations, that Book containeth
<pb facs="tcp:59316:6"/> a full Anſwer to moſt what Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> aliàs <hi>fur Praedeſtinatus,</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> hath againſt <hi>Reformers making God the Authour of ſin.</hi> However, there will yet I truſt, be ſome uſe of my <hi>Book,</hi> both for that, Firſt, Dr. <hi>Kendall's</hi> being in Latine, can only be for the uſe of <hi>Scholars,</hi> but mine being in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may ſerve the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man</hi> too. Secondly, no occaſion was vouchſafed to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctor, to touch upon many things which I have taken much pains about.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I do even skip for joy, that thoſe to whoſe turn it will fall next to deal againſt my Adverſary, will not (I would not for <hi>500 l.</hi> they ſhould be ſo put to it with <hi>Tranſcribers, Printers,</hi> and <hi>Correctors,</hi> as I have been) leaſt Mr. <hi>T.

I truſt, I ſhall yet (do Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> what he can to the contrary) meet with ſome <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Readers,</hi> who for the very ſame Reaſons which I mentioned in the Praeface to the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of Errors, in my <hi>Corrept.

            <p>I Am much your debtor for thoſe undeſerved reſpects to me in your Letter being altogether unknown. But more eſpecially for thoſe large expreſſions of your affection to the late <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Armagh,</hi> and the readineſſe to clear him from ſome aſperſions publickly caſt upon him by one Mr. <hi>Thomas Pierce</hi> in his anſwer to a book of yours. Two Eminent men of each <hi>Univerſity,</hi> before I heard from you, had ſent unto me for their private ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And now upon your Letter and directions I have viewed the ſeverall paſſages tending that way, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. which in ſumme I find amounts to this, <hi>viz. That the late Primate of</hi> Armagh <hi>was, though a late, yet a ſerious Convert. And affirmed, a little, or not long, before his death to ſeverall perſons, that he utterly rejected all thoſe opinions of</hi> Calvin. <hi>That there were evident markes of a Change in him. That a little before his death he profeſſed an utter diſlike to all the whole Doctrine of</hi> Geneva, <hi>in thoſe affaires, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, Tis poſſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Unleſſe that paſſage in his <hi>Pelagian history</hi> may be ſo applyed (wrapped up under the title of <hi>Britanniae Antiquitates, Pelagius</hi> being a <hi>Britain,</hi> which he intended to have taken out and printed as a Treatiſe by it ſelf) where he having given us at large the bold and rugged language with which <hi>Julian,</hi> one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his followers, in defence of his doctrine greets the moſt <hi>milde and meeke</hi> Father St. <hi>Augustine</hi> he adds this, <hi>(Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 312.) <hi>Cuius idcirco verba haec, deſcribenda putavi; ut in hoc ſpeculo contemplaretur lector, conſimiles noſtrorum temporum ardeliones, Thraſoni huic adeó, geminos, ut in eos, hujus ſpiritus quaſi per Pythagoricam quandam</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this particular concerning <hi>univerſal</hi> Redemption I have cauſe to believe there was not any <hi>charge</hi> in him from what his judgment was many years agone: and if he were not <hi>totally</hi> according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> muſt it therefore be argued, he was <hi>wholly</hi> for <hi>Arminius?</hi> might there not be a <hi>mean</hi> wherein he might tread more ſafely according to the <hi>Ancient</hi> doctrine of the <hi>Church?</hi> And indeed, to deal clearly with you, his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in this poynt was in <hi>a middle way</hi> different both from <hi>yours,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pierce's</hi> which if it might not expoſe him to both your pens and cenſures, but be a reconciliation between you (the latter of which I ſee little hope of) I might be moved the more willingly to declare it. I do the rather mention this, becauſe, As Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> ſaith, <hi>you call it the chief head of Arminianiſm, So</hi> he ſaith, tis that <hi>with which other opinions in debate must ſtand or fall:</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 15. excuſeth his prolixity on it, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I may at once quit my ſelf from the <hi>Aſperſion</hi> of having indulged to any vain Credulity againſt him, I muſt firſt once for all <hi>Proteſt</hi> before God and men, that I know but three things in all my book, which I did ſo much as ſeem to give credit to againſt him, and which yet I did not take up upon <hi>bare heareſay &amp;c.</hi> The firſt is, that which here he hath and which again he makes a great ſtirr about, <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp.</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 81. 82. 83. 2 The ſecond, is that about the 600.

Secondly I ſay in reference to the firſt. Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If my Reader will be pleaſed once more to turn to my <hi>Correptory Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p.</hi> 39. he will find that I uſed my utmoſt care and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to inform my ſelf of the truth of it, and I farther back it there, with a probable argument from what he hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59316:24"/> in his <hi>Uncorrect Copy.</hi> The Miniſter from whoſe mouth I took up both the Reports, about his maintaining himſelf to he above ſin, and about his <hi>Denyall of the Lawfullneſſe of ſecond Marriages of Miniſters,</hi> is not a man of mean note in the Miniſtery, nor far off, with whom ſince this laſt Book of his came forth, I have divers times conferred about theſe Reports, and he profeſſeth that upon any juſt occaſion he will juſtify them to his face; and ſtands amazed at his impudent denyall, of what he then ſaid to him; Me thinks therefore his Marginall finger p. 81. is but like that of the Naughty one who beſpeakes his own impudence with his fingers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I cannot but believe, had he not Publikely brought in a large Plea, for the Innocency of Infants <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 25, 26, 27. but that the ſame front of his would beare him out in the denyall of what a perſon of true honor and integrity told me, as having heard it too from his own mouth, that he called a Waggiſh Lad of about four years old an Innocent, free from ſin, who yet I trow hath by this time committed ſome kind of Actuall ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If his Publick and Domeſtick Confeſſions of which he ſpeakes do all ſound a contradiction to, or a Cordiall <hi>Retractation</hi> of what he formerly ſaid to my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brother, I am heartily glad of it, for the good of his Soul, and long I wiſh he may with St. <hi>John</hi>

                     <q>Thirdly, As to the ſecond about the 600 Copies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 54. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Either my memory is intolerable falſe to me, or ſo many were the Number of Copies with <hi>W.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59316:24"/> help it. Thirdly, As yet he acknowledgeth that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time mentioned by me, <hi>Correct Copy,</hi> p. 1. about 200. were divended; too many in all reaſon for the uſe of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate friend. Fourthly, p. 55. he doth ſo hugge himſelf with the conceipt of the quick ſpreading of his Books, as that he apprehends not that I had done him any great wrong, but honoured him rather by publiſhing that ſaying of <hi>W. C.</hi> Thirdly, As for that of the Ladies Dialogue mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. p. 150. 151. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, A moſt Conſcionable able divine, who I think makes as much Conſcience of not telling, <hi>or believing lyes</hi> as any man (in <hi>England),</hi> had by three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which he produced, almoſt brought me into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth of what I ſay about it, <hi>Corrept Correct.</hi> p. 155. and therefore I did ſet it as a <hi>Memorandum</hi> down not in the Text, but in the Margin of my Book, from whence I cannot tell why the Printers took it in to the Text. Secondly, Before I did ſend my <hi>Copy</hi> to the Preſſe ſuſpecting the paſſage ſomewhat too leight, I did draw a <hi>deleatur</hi> over it, but it ſeemes not ſo full an one but that the Printers did Read ſomewhat of that which was in the Margin, and put it into the Text, with an expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>mentioned before,</hi> by which unto all Intelligent Readers they have made it evident (ſeeing no ſuch thing is any where elſe <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly</hi> in <hi>Text</hi> or <hi>Margin</hi> mentioned in my Book) that what they expreſſed there, ſhould have been ſuppreſſed. Thirdly, If my papers ſent up to the Stationer about the <hi>ERRATA,</hi> were over-viewed, I little doubt but that it will be found, that I gave expreſſe order to blot out that paſſage, which yet they did not, as they did not divers others for fear of multiplfying the Catalogue of Errors which I am very certain I ordered the rectification of. 4.

               <p>The expreſſions of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> Doctor <hi>Twiſſe, Zwinglius,</hi> &amp;c. about Gods Efficacious permiſſion of ſin, may poſſibly in ſome things, be too high, in ſome things not ſo well apprehended, or interpreted by Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> who could not reach to the meaning of the Authors ſo wel as themſelves, or who thought not fit to ſpend too much time, in clearing the ſenſe of ſuch places, which the Authours themſelves do abundantly clear in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of their Writings. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Mr. <hi>T.

But as for us poor crazie mortals, if we have no mind to continue in <hi>puris tenebris ignorantiae,</hi> to be wholly left in the <hi>Clowds of darkneſs,</hi> we for the helping of our Childiſh Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, muſt needs diſtinguiſh of all things ſo known by God, and we muſt needs think of ſome order amongſt that infinite
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59316:60"/> number of things which all are at once the objects of Gods <hi>Omniſcience</hi> and <hi>Praeſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly. The beſt diſtinction, which we can poſſibly light upon, is, whereby we diſtinguiſh all things eternally, fore-known, either as merely poſſible to be, or as ſuch things as ſhall have an actual being, or futurition: and then next, whereby we diſtinguiſh moral good things, from moral bad and evill things.</p>
               <p>4. We ſay in <hi>Congruity</hi> hereunto, that all things merely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be, are foreknown by the Lords <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of his own <hi>Omn potence,</hi> if he would be pleaſed to ſet it on work: and <note place="margin">Scientia ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicis Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia.</note> thus the Lord knows thouſands of things more, then ever ſhall have any actuall being, &amp; which he knows can have no being beyond a mere poſſible one, unleſs he determine them to be. But as for the things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Lord knowes, and foreknows will have a certain futurition, he foreknows them all, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his own will and Counſel, whereby from all eternity he <note place="margin">Scientia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis.</note> determines their <hi>futurition,</hi> and without which, he could not know that they ſhould certainly be, unleſs we ſhould be ſo <hi>frantick</hi> and ſo <hi>wicked,</hi> as to maintain, that Creatures from all eternity before their being were foreſeen, to determine both; what their beings would be, and what their actions.</p>
               <p>5ly. As for future morall good things, eſpecially ſuch as accompany Salvation ſuch as are effectual vocation, juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification, &amp;c. he eternally foreſaw they would be in his Own, becauſe he did from eternity, reſolve or decree to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them graciouſly upon his own, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. But as for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moral evil things, whether original or actual ſins, God foreknew them all in the ſame moment of eternity, becauſe even then he did by his permiſſive and ordinative will, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that they ſhould fall out, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. &amp; 4. 28. <note n="(c)" place="margin">

               <p>4ly. As for what he ſaith that the Artic. <hi>Eccleſ. Angl.</hi> 2. 7. 15. 31. proves that no Children have <hi>forfeited their intereſt in the propitiation of Chriſt for the ſins of the whole world, as well originall as actual ſins, and for all ſins of all men as well Actual as Originall.</hi>

P.</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay any thing, for, or againſt <hi>Praedeſtination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being thus diſpatched, I truſt he will not put me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any task, of proving his <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which any body who having read Mr. <hi>T.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59316:69"/> put off the fouleſt Crimes which they can be convinced of. The vulgar have as little acquaintance with <hi>Ebjon, Cerinthus, Arrius,</hi> or with <hi>Socinus Vorſtius,</hi> of late, as with <hi>Arminius,</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> belike it may be lawful for any proud <hi>wanton wits,</hi> to vent their Doctrines among them.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>His ridiculous ſhifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly. I proceed to the third thing mentioned, to his <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſhifts,</hi> for avoiding of the charge of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Maſſilianiſm, Arminianiſm. Ridiculous ſhifts</hi> did I ſay? I ſaid true, but I mean to his crafty <hi>Inſinuations,</hi> to his more Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> of what he moſt cordially <hi>likes</hi> and evidenceth by his ſo idle a <hi>diſlike,</hi> which he teſtifies in his ſeeming <hi>leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>pro forma,</hi> (for the avoiding of clamours which might diſturb his <hi>Cryptick Intereſt)</hi> he powres forth ſome <hi>hug-words,</hi> ſome very hard words againſt them, when p. 8. he ſaith, <hi>I might as well have called him (a Presbyterian, or a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, an Anabaptiſt, or a Witch) as either a whole, or a half Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian. Quid verba audiam facta cum videam?</hi> It is hard by <hi>words</hi> to ſence off <hi>deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, p. 10. he gives us a large account of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes</hi> which he took againſt <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> &amp;c. errors as he ſaith, which he never had <hi>ſo much as any inclination to,</hi> nor ſo much perchance as his fore-father <hi>Adam had without ſin, and before ſin, unto all ſin,</hi> Phil.

Latius. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Semi-Pelagianis.</hi> Cap. 12. it will be eaſie for him to perceive how much <hi>Mr. T. P.</hi> did read without <hi>heeding,</hi> and how ſick the man is ſtill of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſm</hi> and <hi>Semi-Pelagianiſm,</hi> notwithſtanding all the brags of his <hi>Sanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, He highly commends all the three parties which he forſooth recedes from <hi>I. Pelagius,</hi> p. 9. <hi>for being Orthodox as to the main, he meanes as to the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed;</hi> And yet if <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Doctrines may but be judged of, by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59316:69"/> 
                  <hi>thoſe fragments</hi> and <hi>Tranſcripts</hi> of his Writings which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us by <hi>Hieronym.</hi> or by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> never was <hi>Mr. T.

               <p>2. The <hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> or <hi>Maſſilians</hi> he commends, p. 9. <hi>Ibid. for being men of admirable life, and of ſuch Authority in the Church, for their ſanctity of life, that very few durſt contradict them.</hi> And who I trow will be ſo ſimple, as to think that <hi>Mr. T.

               <p>Firſt, Then it is true, that God doth ſincerely <hi>deſire the health and welfare,</hi> &amp;c. of all thoſe of mankind, to whom he propoſeth the <hi>Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour,</hi> if by ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it were enough for him to underſtand that God, without any the leaſt <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>caption,</hi> (which he and his party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten object againſt us) doth will, <hi>i. e.</hi> injoyn or command, that all to whom the Goſpel is preached, ſhould <hi>ex officio, believe, repent,</hi> be <hi>renovated,</hi> &amp;c. that the preaching of the Goſpel, is the only external apt means, for to bring men to <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17.</p>

               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, unleſs any man whileſt he is upon the face of the Earth, could for certain be able to ſay, and make it good, that he were abſolutely reprobated, I wonder, with what ſenſe he can be able to ſay, that Gods <hi>preceptive will,</hi> or his <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> is <hi>but Gods will of his not willing,</hi> when as yet ſuppoſe a man could be certain of his Reprobation, as a Child of God may be of his Election; yet even to ſuch a one, Gods praeceptive will would ſignifie theſe things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is his duty to believe and repent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That God would like of his ſo doing, if he do it.</p>

               <p>Secondly, He might well have cryed out upon me, for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Scripture, if I ſhould have ſo fowly and abſurdly miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted any Scriptures, as he doth two moſt noted ones, that of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 2. with 4. 27, 28. that other of 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. 8. Of the former he is not aſhamed to ſay <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sinner Impleaded, p.</hi> 258, 259.</note> that God determined the <hi>thing (viz.</hi> the crucifying of Chriſt) ſhould be done, <hi>but not that they ſhould do it:</hi> whereas firſt the words of the Text are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59316:82"/> expreſly, that they by wicked hands did <hi>crucifie and ſlay Christ,</hi> according to the determinate Counſel and <hi>foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God; And if we would know who thoſe they were, who ſo did take and kill, and crucifie Chriſt? The Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27, 28. anſwers as punctually as any thing can be. Of a truth, againſt thy holy Child Jeſus, <hi>both Herod and Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, with the Gentiles and people of Iſrael, were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy Counſel determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Thirdly, Were it true, it could not at all ſerve his turn for the clearing of God from being the Authour of ſin; for if that which is notoriouſly falſe, but which he every where ſuppoſed to be true, were indeed ſo, that God cannot in any ſenſe be ſaid to <hi>decree,</hi> or to <hi>will</hi> ſin, but he becomes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſin, the Lord (according to his way of reaſoning) would become ſo by whomſoever, or whenſoever <hi>God</hi> ſhould have determined the Crucifixion of Chriſt to be effected by the naughty wills of men; for good they could not be, who would offer to ſlay the <hi>Prince of life.</hi> About the ſecond, he is bold to ſay, <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Philanth. p.</hi> 48. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note> that it were much better to think, that <hi>David erred in his Conjecture, then to ſpeak irreverently, or indecently of God Almighty.</hi> As if firſt he had proved, that <hi>David,</hi> who at that time, was in as meek, ſound, and calm a temter, as ever he was in, in all his life, had ſpoken irreverently, or indecently, in what he ſaid, or at that time of <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as if <hi>David</hi> in cold blood, would afterwards have injoyned his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> to way-lay <hi>Shimeis life,</hi> and that only for delivering an unpleaſing Meſſage to <hi>David</hi> which, he had as much warrant for, as <hi>Samuel</hi> (they be his own words) <hi>had done before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As if his <hi>ſapleſs ſenſeleſs ſubitane</hi> Comments on this Scripture, were to be preferred above St. <hi>Austins,</hi> and above the ſtream of all ſorts of Interpreters. Mr. T. P's. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Secondly, He aggravates it by the circumſtance of the leaſt conſideration of ſin, which we are ſaid to deny to have place in <hi>Reprobation;</hi> whereas Divine conſideration hath no degrees at all, whereby it may be capable of greater or leſſe, (a fair an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what Mr. <hi>T.

               <p> To come nearer to the point, &amp; to diſcover their jugling, in ſtating our Tenet moſt calumniouſly. Conſider, I pray do any of our <hi>Divines</hi> maintain, that God did ordain to dimn any man but for ſin? (and by poſitive Reprobation in my p. 121. I meant nothing, or could mean nothing but <hi>damnation).</hi> It is apparent, they do not; all acknowledging, that like as God doth damn no man but for ſin, ſo doth he ordain to damn no man but for ſin. And a little after, to add one thing more, not for their ſin which they ſinnedin <hi>Adam</hi> only, but for thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actual ſins and tranſgreſſions which they are guilty of. And if any thing can be ſpoken yet more plainly in the ſame Book, p. 40, 41. having ſpoken of Election, he ſpeaks thus about the decree of Reprobation. The like diſtinction is conſiderable on the part of Reprobation, which alſo is the will of God in a certain kind; I ſay, we muſt diſtinguiſh in this Decree, the act of Gods decreeing, and the things decreed by him. And theſe things are of a different nature, and ſo different, that look what alone is the cauſe of the act, that alone is the cauſe of one thing decreed by it, but not ſo of the other. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the things denyed by Reprobation are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The denyal of Grace.</p>

               <p> Thirdly, It will never be poſſible for him, or the ſtouteſt of his party, to prove Chriſt to be only a <hi>Potential,</hi> and not an <hi>actual Saviour,</hi> unleſ they will undertake to prove and make it good.</p>
               <p>1. That it was not within the compaſſe of Gods abſolute power, if he had been pleaſed to make uſe of it, to have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for mans Salvation, ſome other wayes, than by the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Though here as before, p. 22. he would make us believe, that God hath an <hi>intention to ſave all that periſh,</hi> yet how this ſhould be poſſible, no man can imagine, when as,</p>

               <p>§. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As to the Title ſtuck up in the <hi>front</hi> of this §. 28. p. 108, 109. and again, in the <hi>Reare</hi> of it, from p. 118. to 121. our quarrel about it, would quickly be at an end, if by eternal <hi>puniſhment</hi> he would underſtand <hi>damnation</hi> of a finally ſinful <hi>Creature,</hi> and by the ſole <hi>cauſe of it,</hi> he would likewiſe with the Divines, Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> which he quotes p. 107. underſtand the ſole <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of its <hi>execution;</hi> but if, as may be juſtly ſuſpected, he do by <hi>the cauſe of puniſhment, eternal,</hi> underſtand the cauſe of Gods <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Decree of puniſhing men for their ſins: then firſt, he ſpeaks monſtrouſly, and abſurdly, whileſt he would make <hi>Sin,</hi> which ſure is no older then man, nay not ſo old, and ſo not exiſting but in time, to be the cauſe of Gods eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. <hi>August. Nihil majus voluntate Dei; non ergo cauſa ejus quaerenda est. Ench. ad Laur. c.</hi> 96.</p>
               <p>2. He would make ſin <hi>eternally</hi> foreſeen, but only <hi>potentially</hi> then <hi>existing</hi> to be more <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>cauſal,</hi> then when it <hi>actually</hi> exists in time; for this latter can only be the cauſe of Gods <hi>executing his decree of damnation;</hi> but the former is the cauſe of his <hi>purpoſing</hi> or <hi>intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng</hi> of it. A greater thing it is, to be the cauſe of Gods purpoſe, then to be the cauſe of the <hi>execution</hi> of that purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59316:98"/>
               <p> 3. He ſpills all that <hi>Logick,</hi> p. 64. which he doth pretend to, when he ſaith, that he had never ſo little <hi>Logick,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>That any thing in man could be the cauſe of Gods Decree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. He muſt conclude, That it was neceſſary for all us mortalls to be damned, becauſe from eternity the Lord could not but foreſee, that we ſhould all be either <hi>Originally,</hi> or actually ſinful.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Though p. 107. he do ſtoutly deny, that his Chap. 3. wherein he grants, that <hi>every Reprobate is praedetermined to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment,</hi> is at any <hi>Daggers drawing,</hi> with his almoſt whole Chap. 2. where he <hi>ſtrenuouſly diſputes, that God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines none to puniſhment;</hi> yet 1. the thing is moſt evident; for in his p. 17. Chap. 2. of his <hi>Correct Copy,</hi> he ſaith <hi>expreſly,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt colour of limitation of that his ſaying, that <hi>man himſelf is the ſole efficient cauſe of his eternal puniſhment;</hi> and again, p. 21. that there <hi>can be no greater blaſphemy, then to bring Gods providence into the pedegree of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the only <hi>Salve</hi> which he hath for this ſore, <hi>Phil.</hi> p. 107. <hi>viz.</hi> that I leave out the terme <hi>reſpectively,</hi> which he brings in <hi>lagging Correct Copy,</hi> p. 32.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſhould have brought it in ſooner, if he would have had me to have taken ſome more than ordinary notice of it, and not have been ſo impudent, as to write, that he never ſaid in his <hi>life, that God determines none to puniſhment, there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>2. He ſhould upon <hi>provocation,</hi> have ſhowed which I put him upon, p. 135. <hi>of my Corrept. Correct,</hi> how the <hi>conditionali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or abſoluteneſs of it, alters the caſe;</hi> eſpecially, as to ſin's being the condition of Gods eternal Decree, when as neither that, or any other <hi>Conditions,</hi> could ever be without Gods ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decreeing to effect them in time, or voluntary permitting that in time they ſhould be wrought by others.</p>
               <p>§. 3. As for his vilifying of my <hi>Logick,</hi> which he ſpends full two pages more upon, p. 108, 109. and uſhers in with this <hi>lowd ſounding,</hi> I might almoſt ſay, lowd lying expreſſion, that I will be <hi>tampering in matters, to which in all likelihood and appearance, I was never trained up.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59316:99"/>
               <p> Firſt, Poſſibly ſince my <hi>training</hi> up in that Art, I may have loſt more learning, then yet it appeares that ever he had, or was maſter of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That forſooth our great <hi>Logician</hi> may appear a very great <hi>School-man</hi> too, p. 108. he quotes out of <hi>Biel, Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinas, Scot, Gabriel,</hi> what any freſh man of a moneths ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in either Univerſity, would and could as judiciouſly have quoted out of his greaſie <hi>Jack-Seton, Ramus, Schibler, Crucius, Elementa Burgerſdicii,</hi> or any the moſt vulgar <hi>Logician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If it be an <hi>Adaequate definition of a Cauſe in general,</hi> that it is that <hi>cujus vi res est,</hi> then ſure it cannot be very <hi>inadaequate</hi> to the efficient cauſe, which hath as much, if not more of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality in it, in reference to the effect, than any other cauſe can have, which all derive their cauſality from the <hi>first efficient Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It ſavours of no great <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> either, that in all his whole Diſcourſe, he ſeems not yet to have learned, that there is a vaſt difference betwixt a <hi>Phyſical real</hi> working cauſe of any thing, which I did therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by way of eminency, call the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> and a <hi>morally</hi> metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical working, <hi>or Efficient Cauſe,</hi> which in diſtinction from the former, I did therefore call the <hi>meritorious Cauſe</hi> of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. I never denyed man to be the <hi>meritorious efficient Cauſe</hi> of his <hi>puniſhment;</hi> but I maintained God to be the chief Authour of his puniſhment as the <hi>Decreer of it, &amp; the inflicter of it,</hi> which his Chap. 2. <hi>Correct Copy</hi> plainly denies.</p>
               <p>5. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> ſure may be allowed to have bin trained up to ſome <hi>Logick and Metaphyſicks,</hi> and not to have been the meaneſt Proficient in either: yet there be upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions divers places, wherein he commits as great <hi>Solaciſms</hi> in <hi>Logick</hi> as my ſelf, when he diſtinguiſheth betwixt the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> and <hi>meritorious Cauſe.</hi> But perchance, I ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the greater <hi>Logician and Metaphyſician,</hi> Mr. T.

               <p>Anon after, And truly we confeſs with <hi>Calvin,</hi> that God wills ſins to be, or to fall out, the Lord permitting of it; (for nothing falls out, but <hi>what the Omnipotent wills to fall out,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Auſtin,</hi> either he doing of it, or permitting of it to be done by others); but as yet <hi>Bellarm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, It will follow, that the more ſinful acts any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, the more, he is a <hi>Creator,</hi> &amp; a kind of an <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Do he what he can to the contrary, in ſpite of him, it will follow, that God ſince the fall never did, or doth concur with any the beſt action that ever the holieſt Saint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer man, did act; for unto the beſt of their holieſt performances, as they come from them ſomething of ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, doth ever cleave.

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It will overturn all Divine <hi>Praeſcience</hi> of ſins, and, as I once told him in my <hi>Corrept.

               <p> Sixthly and laſtly, It is an Opinion firſt moſt contrary to holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> which when it ſpeaks moſt properly of ſin, it ſpeaks of it as of a <hi>Privative,</hi> not as of a <hi>Poſitive thing,</hi> under the notions of <hi>vanity, emptineſs, darkneſs, Anomy,</hi> no <hi>Profit, no good, no knowledge, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>To what he hath about <hi>Adams</hi> inclination to ſin, before the Fall, Chap. 4. §. 24. <hi>He hath a ſtrangely weak</hi> and falſe aſſertion of A. <hi>Rivet, in the Margin of his</hi> 38. page, which he ſaith, <hi>will prove unavoidably true,</hi> viz. <hi>that they who affirm an inclination to ſin before the Fall, do lay all the fault of the ſin, upon God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of nature; ſince ſuch an inclination cannot but be vitious, which yet muſt needs have been from God, if it were before the fall.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is well known, that Learned Doctor <hi>Rivet</hi> could tell how to make very ſtrong <hi>Scholaſtick Arguments,</hi> before Mr. <hi>T. P.</hi> did ever ſo much as peere in <hi>Divi Luminis Auras.</hi>

               <p>3. He hath not, as yet, ſhowed how <hi>Adam</hi> had, or poſſibly could have any thing before the Fall, but what he had from God, and <hi>Ergo, if he had this inclination unto ſin in him,</hi> (and that prove but to be ſinful, as I ſhall ſhow preſently) <hi>before the fall,</hi> it will follow inevitably, that God is the Authour of ſin, or he is not the Authour of all that <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall; and ſo he hath not enervated Dr. <hi>Rivet's</hi> Arguments; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he declaims againſt others, who are innocent of it, he himſelf <hi>maintains God to be the Authour of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now that an inclination unto ſin, which is as a weight-Plummet inclining, or as I may ſo ſay, ballaſting the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, is in it ſelf ſinful, I prove thus, That which comes from ſin, and only tends to it, and is terminated in it, as it is ſuch, that muſt needs be ſin.

               <p>Thirdly, If any more need to be ſaid, and much better ſaid then I have done, why bleſſed be God, bleſſed be God for it, there be yet in the Univerſities, and elſe-where, ſage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Doctors enough, to do that.
